✅ Problem Solved: Base 7 (LeetCode 504)

🧩 Problem Summary
Given an integer num, convert it to its base 7 representation as a string.

Handle both positive and negative numbers

Do not use built-in base conversion utilities

💡 Approach Used
✔ Handle edge case: if num == 0 → return "0"
✔ Track sign for negative numbers
✔ Repeatedly:

Take remainder num % 7

Append it to result

Divide num by 7

✔ Reverse the constructed string
✔ Add - sign back if needed

⚙ Time Complexity: O(log₇ N)
📦 Space Complexity: O(log₇ N)

✨ Takeaway
Understanding number systems and manual base conversion strengthens fundamentals and helps avoid over-reliance on libraries.
