✅ Day 31 – Problem: Maximum Gap (LeetCode 164)

Problem Statement:
Find the maximum difference between successive elements in the sorted form of an unsorted array — in linear time.

Approach Used:
Implemented Bucket Sort using the Pigeonhole Principle:

Computed minimum and maximum of the array.

Created buckets to capture element ranges.

Calculated gaps between consecutive non-empty buckets to find the maximum gap.

Complexity:

Time: O(N)

Space: O(N)

Language: Java ☕
