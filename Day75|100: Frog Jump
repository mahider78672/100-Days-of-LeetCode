✅ Day 75 – Problem: Frog Jump
Problem

Given stone positions in a river, determine if a frog can reach the last stone following constrained jump rules.

Approach

Use a HashMap<Stone, Set<JumpSizes>>

Initialize position 0 with jump size 0

For each stone and jump size:

Try k-1, k, k+1 (greater than 0)

If next stone exists, add jump size to its set

Check if the last stone has any valid jump
