✅ Day 48 – Problem: Palindrome Partitioning (LeetCode 131)

Problem:
Partition a string so every substring is a palindrome. Return all possible partitions.

Approach:
• Used Depth-First Search with backtracking.
• Expanded substring ranges and validated palindromes.
• Constructed solutions recursively and backtracked to explore all paths.

Complexity:
Time: O(N × 2ⁿ)
Space: O(N)

Language: Java ☕
