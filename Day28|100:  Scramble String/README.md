✅ Day 28 – Problem: Scramble String

Problem Statement:
Determine if one string is a scrambled version of another using recursive swaps.

Approach Used:

Recursive comparison with both swap and no-swap scenarios.

Used a HashMap for memoization of string pairs.

Added a helper to ensure both strings have the same character frequency before recursion.

Complexity:

Time: O(n⁴)

Space: O(n²)

Language: Java ☕
