Day 29 – Problem: Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree

Problem Statement:
Check if the given preorder serialization of a binary tree is valid without constructing the tree.

Approach Used:

Count available “slots” while iterating over nodes.

Each non-null node consumes one slot and creates two new ones.

At the end, a valid tree should have exactly 0 remaining slots.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)

Language: Java ☕
