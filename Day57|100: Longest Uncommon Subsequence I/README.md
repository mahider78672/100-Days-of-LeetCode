✅ Day 57 – Problem: Longest Uncommon Subsequence I

Problem:
Given two strings, return the length of the longest subsequence that is not common to both.

Approach:
• If both strings are equal → no uncommon subsequence exists → return -1.
• Otherwise, the longer string itself is the LUS.

Complexity:
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)
