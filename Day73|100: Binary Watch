✅ Day 73 – Problem: Binary Watch (LeetCode 401)
Problem

Given the number of LEDs that are turned on, generate all possible valid times on a binary watch.

Approach

Iterate over all possible hours (0–11) and minutes (0–59)

Count set bits in both numbers

If total set bits == turnedOn, add formatted time to result

Ensure:

Hour ≤ 11

Minute ≤ 59

Minute has leading zero if needed
